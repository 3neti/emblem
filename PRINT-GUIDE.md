# PRINT GUIDE — Emblem Icon Sequence
## Instructions for Screen Printer

---

## 1. What You're Printing

A horizontal row of 7 small solid-fill icons (handshake, heart, peace sign, pistol, airplane, star, rose). All icons are simple filled silhouettes — no gradients, no halftones, no outlines. **Single-color, single-pass print.**

---

## 2. Files to Use

**Primary art file (use one of these):**
- `emblem-black.svg` — Clean vector SVG, no metadata. **Preferred for RIP software.**
- `emblem-print.pdf` — Print-ready PDF. Use if your workflow prefers PDF.

**Reference files (do NOT print these):**
- `emblem-dimensions.svg` — Shows exact measurements, spacing, and bounding boxes
- `emblem-swatches.svg` — Color options on different shirt backgrounds
- `emblem-master.svg` — Source file with comments (for editing only)

---

## 3. Artwork Dimensions (at 100%)

- **Width: 107 mm** (~4.21 in)
- **Height: 10 mm** (~0.39 in)
- Aspect ratio: 10.7:1 (very wide and short)

The art is drawn at actual print size. **Do NOT scale** unless specifically noted below for sleeve placement.

---

## 4. Placement — LEFT CHEST

- Position: **left chest, centered on the pectoral area**
- Horizontal: align the center of the emblem roughly with the left nipple line
- Vertical: approximately **7–9 cm (3–3.5 in) below the collar seam**
- Keep the icon row **perfectly horizontal** (parallel to the hem)
- Print at **100% scale** (107 × 10 mm)

## 5. Placement — SLEEVE

- Position: **outer sleeve, upper arm area**
- Approximately **8–10 cm (3–4 in) below the shoulder seam**, centered on the outer face of the sleeve
- Keep horizontal (parallel to the sleeve hem)
- **Recommended scale: 120–130%** to compensate for the curved surface and smaller visual area
  - At 120%: 128 × 12 mm
  - At 130%: 139 × 13 mm
- If printing both sleeves: use the **same placement mirror** (same distance from shoulder, centered on outer face)
- If printing one sleeve only: **left sleeve preferred** (visible when the wearer's arm is at their side)

## 6. Ink Color Options

The artwork is provided in black (#000000). **Change the fill color to match your chosen ink.**

### Recommended combinations:

**White shirt:**
- Black ink (#000000) — classic, high contrast ✓ RECOMMENDED
- Navy ink (#1B2A4A) — subtle, sophisticated
- Charcoal ink (#4A4A4A) — soft, understated

**Black shirt:**
- White ink (#FFFFFF) — clean, bold ✓ RECOMMENDED
- Gold ink (#C9A84C) — premium feel
- Silver ink (#A8A8A8) — metallic, modern

**Gray shirt:**
- Black ink (#000000) — safe, readable
- White ink (#FFFFFF) — punchy
- Navy ink (#1B2A4A) — tonal

See `emblem-swatches.svg` for visual previews of all 9 combinations.

## 7. Technical Notes for the Printer

- **Color mode:** Spot color (single ink). No CMYK separation needed.
- **Mesh/screen:** Standard mesh for solid fills. No halftone dots.
- **Minimum detail:** The smallest icon features are approximately 0.5 mm at 100% scale. Use a mesh count that resolves this (230+ mesh for fine detail, 160 mesh for standard).
- **Registration:** Single color = single screen. No registration concerns.
- **Flash/cure:** Standard for the ink type used.
- **The rose icon is intentionally spaced further** from the other 6 icons (12 mm gap vs 5 mm). This is deliberate — do not "fix" the spacing.
- **The pistol icon is rotated 20°** and faces left. This is intentional.

## 8. Preflight Checklist

Before printing, verify:
- [ ] Art opens cleanly in your RIP software (no missing fonts — there are none)
- [ ] All 7 icons are visible, including the rose on the far right
- [ ] Dimensions read 107 × 10 mm at 100%
- [ ] Fill color has been changed to match the chosen ink (if not black)
- [ ] Placement is marked on the shirt using the positions above
- [ ] Sleeve prints are scaled up if using the 120–130% recommendation

---

## 9. Contact / Notes

- Art is all vector (infinitely scalable without quality loss)
- All icons are sourced from open-source libraries (CC0, MIT, Apache 2.0, CC Attribution)
- If the printer needs the art in a different format (AI, EPS, DXF), the SVG can be converted in Illustrator or Inkscape
