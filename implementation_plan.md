# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN  
## Left-Chest Icon Emblem — Designer Brief

---

## 1. Objective

Design a minimalist monoline icon sequence for placement on the left chest of a white long-sleeve shirt.

The design must be restrained, symbolic, and precise.  
Avoid decorative, cartoonish, or emoji-like appearance.

---

## 2. Icon Sequence (Fixed Order)

🤝 ❤️ ✌️ 🔫 ✈️ ⭐   🌹

- The first six icons form a continuous sequence.
- The rose is separate and must be visually spaced apart.

---

## 3. Overall Dimensions

- Total width: **68 mm**
- Approximate height: **10 mm**

---

## 4. Icon Box Specifications

Each icon must fit within:

- **10 mm × 10 mm square**
- Actual drawn height: **8–9 mm**
- Vertically center-aligned

---

## 5. Spacing Rules

- **5 mm spacing** between icons 1–6
- **8 mm spacing** between ⭐ and 🌹

Do not modify spacing.

---

## 6. Stroke and Line Requirements

- Stroke thickness: **0.8 mm**
- Uniform stroke weight across all icons
- Round line caps
- Round line joins
- No fills
- No shading
- No gradients
- Single color: **Black (#000000)**

The rose may be slightly finer but must not go below **0.7 mm**.

---

## 7. Icon Style Guidelines

All icons must be:

- Monoline
- Minimal
- Geometrically clean
- Recognizable but simplified
- Non-emoji in appearance
- Free of unnecessary detail

Specific guidance:

**Handshake (🤝)**  
Abstract overlapping hands. Avoid realism.

**Heart (❤️)**  
Symmetrical outline only.

**Two Fingers / Peace (✌️)**  
Simple V-shape with minimal palm indication.

**Finger Gun (🔫)**  
Highly abstract gesture. No realistic weapon detail.

**Airplane (✈️)**  
Minimal side profile silhouette.

**Star (⭐)**  
Balanced 5-point outline star.

**Rose (🌹)**  
Single-line rose, minimal detail, one stem only.

---

## 8. Placement Reference (For Scale Only)

- Intended for **left chest**
- Icon row should remain horizontal
- Do not redesign layout orientation

---

## 9. Required Deliverables

Provide the following files:

1. Master vector file (**AI or SVG**)
2. Outlined/expanded stroke version
3. Black-only version
4. Print-ready PDF
5. Dimension reference sheet

---

## 10. Guides and Measurement Requirement (Important)

The final vector deliverable **must include visible rulers or guide lines** showing:

- Overall width (68 mm)
- Icon box boundaries (10 mm × 10 mm)
- Spacing measurements (5 mm / 8 mm)
- Baseline and vertical center alignment

Guides must be clean, labeled, and precise.

---

## 11. Non-Negotiable Rules

- Do not change icon order
- Do not change spacing
- Do not vary stroke weight
- Do not add fills or effects
- Do not stylize beyond minimal monoline form

---

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

The design is acceptable if:

- It appears minimal and precise
- It reads as symbolic rather than decorative
- It remains clear at small scale
- It avoids emoji-like appearance
- It maintains consistent geometry and stroke weight
